http://rtext.sourceforge.net
----------------------------

2.5.1 (11/12/2013):

2.0.6 (01/25/2013):
-------------------
   - Added syntax highlighting and code folding for JSON files.

     and lists use Substance's fancy rendering, and a few custom colors in the
     UI were tweaked to look better in this Look and Feel.
   - Fixed bug: Adding or modifying a JRE for code completion in the Java
     options panel threw a ClassCastException.
   - Decent refactoring of the code, which shouldn't be noticeable for users.

2.0.5.1 (12/20/2012):
---------------------
   - Updated to RSTA 2.0.5.1; this fixes a keyboard bug experienced with
     non-QWERTY keyboards.

     literals, binary literals, and new core classes/interfaces/enums).
   - Fixed an issue with CompleteMarkupTagAction and ToggleLineCommentAction
     conflicting with each other only on *nix (Windows and OS X didn't have
     this issue).
   - Fixed possible NPE when editing XML on Linux only (!).
   - RText is now building on OS X once again.
   - Now ships with Groovy 1.8.8, so you no longer have to drop in your own
     groovy-all-xxx.jar to run Groovy macros in RText.
   - Added keyboard shortcuts for moving through docked window groups
     (Ctrl+Alt+arrow keys).
   - Updated translations - Chinese (peter_barnes), Russian (Nadiya), Italian
     (Argaar), German (Domenic), Korean (Changkyoon), Japanese (Josh), and
     Hungarian (Zityi).


2.0.4 (09/07/2012):
-------------------

     as some minor Clojure syntax highlighting improvements.
   - The default editor font has changed to Consolas on Windows Vista and 7.
   - Decreased memory usage required for regex find and replace operations.
   - Improved performance of Mark Occurrences, especially when there are lots
     and lots of them.
   - Added E4X syntax highlighting to the JavaScript highlighter (disabled by
     default since it's rarely used).
   - Added an option to have bracket matching highlight both brackets in the
     pair, instead of just the "opposite" one.
   - Fix to RTextScrollPane to facilitate using it in the NetBeans GUI builder.
   - Updated translations:  Chinese (peter_barnes), Russian (Nadiya), Polish
     (Chris), Spanish (Leonardo), Brazilian Portuguese (Pat), and Korean
     (Changkyoon).

2.0.3 (05/02/2012):
-------------------
   - Added code folding for several languages, including C, C++, Java, Perl,

     Currently only for Java, JavaScript, and XML.
   - The Source Browser's tree view of source code is now sortable.
   - License changed to modified BSD from GPL.  This allows folks to use pieces
     of RText without making their entire application GPL.


1.5.0 (09/03/2011):
-------------------
   - Added scripted macro support.  You can now write macros in either
     JavaScript or Groovy and assign them shortcuts, essentially creating your
     own custom menu item actions.
   - Added very basic JSP code completion.
   - Add "stop" button to tool console like Console console.
   - Updated to RSyntaxTextArea/AutoComplete 1.5.2.  Improves anti-aliasing in

     whitespace-only lines on Enter presses, and painting indent/tab lines.
   - Added "Check for Updates" menu item to Help menu.
   - Made opening a file via Find in Files dialog center the matched line
     vertically in the editor.


1.4.0 (05/29/2011):
-------------------
   - Added Flex (MXML) syntax highlighting and source browser support.
   - Added Clojure syntax highlighting.
   - Fixed bug: the default directory for new files wasn't persisted when
     modified in the Options dialog.  Thanks pmsl in the forums!
   - Added a Console plugin.  This allows you to run system commands (like a
     shell), as well as interact directly with the RText UI using its API via
     JavaScript (Rhino).
   - Improved Java code completion.
   - Updated Dutch translation (thanks Rogier), Korean translation (Kwangsub),
     and Traditional Chinese translation (kp200906).


1.3.1 (11/23/2010):
-------------------
   - Fixed bug: Options dialog doesn't open if Perl is not installed on the
     machine.  Thanks pmsl from the forums for pointing this out!
   - Fixed tab size not being saved/reloaded properly.  Thanks again pmsl!
   - Big speed-up in Java code completion when lazy loading lots of class
     completions for the first time (e.g. first completion popup displaying
     for a source file with lots of wildcard imports).
   - Small fix to "General" option panel in Options dialog: "Apply" button
     shouldn't become enabled if "Restore Defaults" is pressed when the
     options selected were already the defaults.


1.3.0 (11/18/2010):
-------------------
   - Adding drop shadows to menus - thanks to JGoodies (http://jgoodies.com).
   - Revamped external LookAndFeel support.  Several Substance 6.1 skins are
     now selectable by default in RText.
   - Text matches in the "Find in Files" dialog are now syntax highlighted.
   - Translucent search windows now work on Java 7+, not just Java 6.
   - Added Copy, Paste, and Delete popup menu items on the File System Tree.
   - Added PERL5LIB modification support to the Perl parser - see the Perl
     options panel in the Options dialog.
   - Added a "Libraries" tab to the About dialog listing all external libraries
     RText uses.
   - Fixed a bug with "variables" not working for tool directories (i.e.
     ${file_dir}).
   - Fixed several bugs in Java code completion.
   - The relevant Throwable is now included in completion choices when inside
     of a catch block when editing Java.
   - Logging any uncaught EDT throwables to a log file in user's home directory
     (AWTExceptionHandler).
   - Fixed NPE in FindInFilesTable when user switches from WinLAF to another
     one (workaround for JRE bug 6429812).
   - The order you put file chooser favorite directories in is now remembered.
   - Updated Spanish translation (phrodo).


1.1.0 (03/15/2010):
-------------------
   - Added "external tool" support.  Similar to Eclipse, this allows you to
     define and run external processes, and get their output in a docked window.
   - Improved "Tasks" support.  The user can now define what words denote
     "tasks" in the options menu.
   - Improved ctrl+arrow key navigation in the text editor (now works like
     Eclipse) as well as word selection when double-clicking with the mouse.
   - Added an option to show EOL markers in the editor.
   - Fixed exception thrown when spell-checking plain text.
   - Code cleanup and simplification, especially of "plugin" architecture.
   - Fixed a handful of smaller bugs.
   - Updated translations:  Turkish (Burak), Dutch (Roel), Brazilian Portuguese
     (Marcos), Spanish (Rafael), Arabic (Linostar), Simplified Chinese
     (Sunquan).
   - Added Polish translation (thanks Maciej!).


1.0.0 (12/03/2009):
-------------------
   - Added a spelling checker.  This long-requested feature works much like it
     does in Eclipse.  A misspelled word is squiggle underlined.  Hovering the
     mouse over the spelling error yields a focusable tool tip, from which the
     user can correct the misspelling, add the word to a user dictionary, or
     ignore the word for the rest of the RText session.
   - Added a "Tasks" dockable window.  Like the one found in Eclipse, this
     window lists all items marked as "TODO" and "FIXME" in source code
     comments in all opened files.
   - Added Scala syntax highlighting.
   - Added Delphi syntax highlighting and Source Browser support.
   - Added BBCode syntax highlighting.
   - When editing XML, closing tags are auto-completed.  This can be
     toggled via the Options dialog.
   - The file chooser and File System Tree both now allow you to open files in
     the system default viewer or editor.  This feature requires Java 6.
   - The file chooser now uses a "breadcrumb bar" component, similar to the
     file chooser in Windows Vista.
   - When using the "Split View," the file list is now displayed in a real
     dockable window, making for much better integration with the rest of the
     UI.
   - In the "Split View," the file list now has a context menu when a file is
     right-clicked.
   - The "Document Properties" dialog now includes the word count of the file.
   - Cleaned up the main application's interface.
   - Fixed a silent NPE when doing a "replace all" with regex enabled, and the
     replacement text was the empty string.


0.9.9.9 (07/22/2009):
---------------------
   - If you edit a file with no extension, RText now guesses the file content
     type by checking for a "#!" line at the top.  If it finds one, it
     highlights the file appropriately.  This helps with file types that often
     have no extension, such as shell scripts.  This feature can be toggled in
     the "File Filters" panel of the Options dialog.
   - Content Assist is available in the Find and Replace dialogs when regular
     expressions are enabled.  Ctrl+Space will display a list of regex
     constructs for the current caret position.
   - Add Lisp language support (syntax highlighting and Source Browser).
   - Large amount of code cleanup and re-organization.
   - RTL improvements throughout the UI (usually in combo boxes and tables).
   - Better-behaved Mark Occurrences support.
   - Default value of the "Use BOM in UTF-8" option is now false (as it always
     should have been).
   - Updated translations: German (Pete), Turkish (Burak), Spanish (Rafael), 
     Russian (Vladimir), Indonesian (XXX), Arabic (Linostar), Japanese (izumi).


0.9.9.8 (03/04/2009):
---------------------
   - Added bookmarking support.  This is configurable in the new "Gutter"
     panel in the Options dialog.
   - Added "Mark Occurrences" support.  This can be configured in the Options
     dialog, under "Text Editor" -> "Caret and Selection".
   - Added PHP syntax highlighting (including source browser).
   - Source Browser can now use regular ctags as well as Exuberant ctags.
   - A middle mouse button click now closes a tab.
   - Added "thick vertical line" caret, similar to that seen in Eclipse and
     NetBeans.
   - Improved size grip on main window and Find in Files dialog.
   - Minor bug fixes.
   - Updated French, Russian and Italian translations.


0.9.9.7 (12/08/2008):
---------------------
   - Added "Open Remote" and "Save Remote" options to load and save remote
     files via ftp or http (Feature Request 1210965).
   - The file chooser's filename text field tries to be even friendlier and
     pre-fills in the next matching filename when possible, similar to Microsoft
     Office.  This can be toggled on or off in the Options dialog.
   - Some languages now recognize hyperlinks in comments.  These hyperlinks
     are clickable (Ctrl+click) and open the link in the system default web
     browser (requires Java 6).  This behavior is configurable in the Options
     dialog.
   - Changing the encoding or line separator of a file via the "Document
     Properties" dialog now marks the file as dirty.
   - The Windows version now sends files to the Recycle Bin when you delete
     them from the file chooser.
   - Added Makefile language support (highlighting and source browser).
   - Added Ruby language support (highlighting and source browser).
   - Made file opening slightly more efficient.
   - Fixid bug 2315788: Replace dialog didn't like empty "Replace with" strings.
   - Added "Open in new window" option to File System Tree's popup menu.
   - "Save a Copy As Web Page..." now passes XHTML 1.0 Strict validation.
   - Fixed RTL issues when running in Arabic locale (tables, plugin trees).
   - Updated translations: Arabic (thanks Linostar), Chinese (SunYi),
     Hungarian (Flatron), Russian (Vladimir), Spanish (Rafael), Turkish (Burak).



0.9.9.6 (09/12/2008):
---------------------
   - Fixed a bug in RTF copy/paste.
   - Separated RSyntaxTextArea into its own project.  Check out
     http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea for more information.
   - Fixed bug 2056201: Plugins menu wasn't populated on OS X.
   - When doing a find or replace with regular expressions enabled, regex
     errors are now identified on the fly, highlighted in red, and a tooltip
     displays the exact error.
   - Improved XML syntax highlighting.  Multiline attributes and single-quoted
     attributes are now supported, and entity references are better recognized.
   - Slightly improved startup time.
   - A few small bug fixes.
   - Updated French and German translations (thanks Pivwan and Pete).


0.9.9.5 (06/25/2008):
---------------------
   - Added "Copy as RTF" menu item.  Its shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+C, and
     can be configured from the Shortcuts panel of the Options dialog. This
     allows you to copy-and-paste syntax highlighted code into applications
     such as Outlook.
   - Updated some custom components that had problems with the upcoming
     Nimbus Look and Feel (actually, any LaF that didn't extend
     BasicLookAndFeel could have had problems).
   - Font choosers now display several common fonts known to be monospaced
     in bold.  Not all monospaced fonts will be detected, but most of the
     common ones will be.
   - Removed OfficeLnFs source from the RText source distribution.  The source
     distribution now only comes with the OfficeLnFs jar file, and its license
     file (that states where to find the source).
   - The OfficeLnFs jar is no longer a part of the *NIX and Mac packages.
     It never made sense to be in them anyway, since those LaFs aren't usable
     on those platforms.
   - Updated some child dialogs of the Options dialog.


0.9.9.4 (04/09/2008):
---------------------
   - Cleaned up Options dialog code.
   - Added "Favorites" functionality to the file chooser.  You can now
     mark directories as "Favorites" and have them available from a popup
     menu.
   - Added wide-char related functions (wchar.h) to function list for C.
   - You can now set what text antialiasing method RText will use in code
     editors.  The actual methods available to choose from depend on your
     JVM version.
   - Added JSP syntax highlighting.
   - Updated Perl syntax highlighting.  Changes include:
        1. Recognizes variables of the form ${foo} as well as $foo.
        2. Recognizes "heredoc" <<EOF syntax (not exhaustive, only common
           cases).
        3. Recognizes POD blocks.
        4. Recognizes m//, s///, tr///, and y/// patterns (again, this isn't
           exhaustive, only common cases).
        5. Should be faster overall.
   - Removed a couple of unused files from the source distribution.
   - Updated translations: Arabic, Spanish, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese,
     Korean, Dutch, Russian, Turkish, and Traditional Chinese.


0.9.9.3 (12/20/2007):
---------------------
   - Added Groovy language support (Feature Request 1803457).
   - Added Tcl language support (syntax highlighting and source browser)
     (Feature Request 1796206).
   - The Source Browser now analyzes Lua files.
   - Fixed bug 1807734: Character insertions were not included in macros.
   - Added accelerators to file chooser's popup menu actions: "F2" is now a
     shortcut for "Rename", and "F5" is a shortcut for "Refresh".
   - Added an option to display the hostname in the title bar.  This option is
     togglable in the "User Interface" panel of the Options dialog.
   - Fixed some stuff pointed out by FindBugs (see
     http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/).
   - Made Shift+Home toggle between selecting to the start of a line, and
     selecting to the first non-whitespace character in the line.
   - Made the link to the RText home page in the About dialog clickable (only
     supported on 1.6 JRE's or newer).
   - Made background chooser dialog resizable.
   - If you're using a 1.5 JRE or greater, you can select *.bmp files for
     your background now.
   - Fixed bug 1813006: Filename dropdown in file chooser "popping under"
     on 1.6 JRE's.
   - Fix Source Browser bug - opening java file uses ctags for wrong
     language (only lists "Functions").
   - Fixed error recovery when ctags.exe specified is invalid.
   - Improved SQL syntax highlighting - more keywords recognized, standard
     SQL99 functions are colored, and multiline comments are now colored.
   - Updated translations:  Spanish, French, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian,
     Japanese, Dutch, Russian, Turkish, and Traditional Chinese.


0.9.9.2 (09/10/2007):

     default to the currently-entered directory.
   - Made table columns in Find in Files/Replace in Files dialogs sortable.
   - Shift+Backspace now behaves just like Backspace in the editor.  Previously,
     it did nothing.
   - Solaris packages have been made available on the SourceForge download
     page.  Thanks to Steve Christensen for doing this!  Be sure to check out
     his website, www.sunfreeware.com, for more great Solaris software.

     (finally!).  These are configurable on the "Text Area" option panel.
   - Made token background painting faster.
   - You now get a more detailed error message when an I/O error occurs

   - Updated Russian translation (Vladimir).
   - Updated Spanish translation (phrodo).
   - Updated Turkish translation (Burak).
   - Updated to OfficeLnFs 2.2.


0.9.5.0 (03/25/2006):
---------------------
   - You can now set the default encoding for new documents from the Options
     dialog.
   - You can also now configure RText to warn you before opening files larger
     than an arbitrary size.  This can come in handy because, unfortunately,
     most JVMs' default maximum heap sizes are too small for editing large text
     files.  So, for example, you could configure RText to warn you before
     opening files larger than 20MB if you're opening log files of arbitrary
     size to keep from accidentally opening the 200MB one.  By default this
     option is off.
   - Made the "Printing" panel of the options dialog look a little nicer.
   - Made HTML files created via "Save a Copy as HTML" more compact.
   - Cleaned up the localization code a little.
   - Fixed bug when selecting the "Find" text from combo box's history
     in Find in Files dialog.
   - Updated to OfficeLnFs 2.1.


0.9.4.5 (03/08/2006):
---------------------
   - Replace operations now recognize captured groups when "Regular Expressions"
     is selected (RFE 1438886).  For example, if you have the text
        if (x<7) {
     and replace "(\w+)<(\d+)" with "$2<$1", the new value of the text will be:
        if (7<x) {
   - Fixed Bug 1431105, which caused all files opened from the Find in Files
     dialog to be opened with the system's default encoding.
   - Fixed Bug 1428584, which sometimes left a plugin title bar displaying the
     wrong plugin name.
   - The speed of a "Find in Files" search when "Regular Expressions" is
     enabled has been greatly improved.
   - Added Korean translation (thanks sbrownii!).
   - Updated Russian translation (Vladimir).
   - Updated Dutch translation (Sebastiaan).
   - Updated German translation (bikerpete).
   - Updated Turkish translation (Burak).
   - Updated OfficeLnFs.jar to 2.0.
   - Fixed a UI "bug" that caused exceptions to be thrown when a menu item
     without an icon was armed when using a 6.0 b74 JRE.


0.9.4.0 (01/13/2006):
---------------------
   - Added Python syntax highlighting.
   - Fix bug where closing "last" document in tabbed pane does not give
     focus to the newly-fucused text area (Bug ID 1387510).
   - Made the file chooser case-insensitive for OS X (Bug ID 1387585).
   - Fixed bug:  Open the same file twice so they're numbered (1) and (2), then
     save (2) with a new filename - the first file's (1) does not disappear
     (Bug ID 1387594).
   - Updated Hungarian translation (Flatron).
   - Added Portuguese translation (thanks Leandro!).
   - The scanners used for syntax highlighting are now in their own package.
   - Updated JFlex-based scanners to using 1.4.1 (the latest JFlex release).


0.9.3.5 (12/06/2005):
---------------------
   - RText now takes command line arguments.  Files to initially open can be
     specified on the command line (Bug ID 1349745).  The RText.exe starter
     executable shipped with the Windows version can also take a special
     "jvmargs" parameter specifying parameters for the JVM.  This parameter
     MUST be wrapped in quotes to be parsed correctly.  An example:
        RText.exe -jvmargs "-Xmx256M" C:\foo.java
   - A Mac OSX application package is now a download option.
   - Fixed bug on OSX that made the "OK" button on the Options dialog not
     work (Bug ID 1357539).
   - Fixed a bug in the Find in Files dialog when doing regular expression
     searches (Bug ID 1356899).
   - Fixed a bug that made many icon groups not work if running on UNIX
     (Bug ID 1364382).
   - RText now works as an "external editor" in Total Commander.  This was a
     side effect of making RText accept command line arguments (Bug ID 1270550).
   - Fixed a bug that made it possible to have some of the UI in one language
     and some in another (Bug ID 1349750).
   - Tokens can now be styled with an underline as well as bold and italics.
   - The UI for plugin tabbed panes has been completely redone to somewhat
     resemble those in Visual Studio.  I'm trying to make the appearance unique,
     but I want to be sure it looks good in all Look and Feels.  Any feedback
     on the new appearance is welcome.
   - HTML syntax highlighting was redone to be much more efficient.  If you see
     ANY errors in HTML document rendering, please let me know!
   - DTD elements are now syntax highlighted in XML files.
   - Various tweaks for Mac OS X.
   - When using the tabbed pane view, each tab now has a tooltip containing
     the full path of its file.
   - Made increase/decrease indent menu items use more common shortcuts ('tab'
     and 'shift+tab' respectively).
   - Made the GUI look a little better when Motif Look and Feel is used.
   - Fixed a small bug in the Source Browser plugin - it parsed the newly active
     buffer twice instead of once when a document was closed.
   - Updated the splash screen/about dialog image.
   - Added Russian translation (thanks Vladimir!).
   - Fixed and updated Hungarian translation (Flatron).
   - Updated Dutch translation (Sebastiaan).
   - Updated Turkish translation (Burak).


0.9.3.0 (10/28/2005):
---------------------
   - Made the Find in Files dialog run searches in a separate thread.
   - Fixed a bug in the file chooser that prevented the editing of files in
     any encoding other than the system default and Unicode (Bug ID 1301806).
   - The Source Browser stopped working in 0.9.2.6; this is fixed
     (Bug ID 1295881).
   - The Source Browser can now use syntax-highlighted tooltips for a more
     attractive presentation.
   - The Source Browser now parses Fortran, JavaScript and SQL files.
   - Added a JVM "Heap Indicator" plugin.  Disabled by default, this plugin
     is a progress bar in RText's status bar that tells you the current state
     of the JVM heap.  Double-clicking on it will attempt to perform a garbage
     collection.
   - When drag-and-dropping tabs in the tabbed view, you now see a gray
     rectangle indicating where the tab will be placed, giving more visual
     assurance.
   - Updated German translation (bikerpete).
   - Updated Dutch translation (Sebastiaan).
   - Updated Italian translation (stepagweb).
   - Updated French translation (PivWan).
   - The Find and Replace dialogs are now initially populated with the
     currently selected text, if the selection is non-empty (Feature Request
     1338387).
   - A couple of minor enhancements to the Options dialog.
   - Fixed an erroneous error message when searching for strings with '+' in
     them via the Find dialog and the string wasn't found.
   - Modified the behavior of the left and right arrow keys in the text area
     when there is a selection to behave more like modern applications.
   - The Ant build scripts for RText and the standard plugins now make it easy
     to build "debug" versions of RText (e.g., line numbers in stack traces,
     etc.).
   - Added a workaround to Sun Bug ID 6329226, which would sometimes cause
     RText to hang when run over Exceed.
   - Upgraded to OfficeLnFs 1.1.2.


0.9.2.6 (09/15/2005):
---------------------
   - Added CSS syntax highlighting.
   - The size of docked plugins is now remembered between sessions (Feature
     Request 1238530).
   - Added Hungarian translation (thanks Flatron!).
   - Updated Dutch translation (Sebastiaan).
   - Updated to OfficeLnFs 1.1.1.


0.9.2.3 (09/01/2005):
---------------------
   - You can now associate filename extensions with colors in the file chooser.
     For example, if you associate the color blue with files ending in "java",
     then the file chooser will display the filenames of all *.java files in
     blue.  This makes a directory listing easy to parse visually for the files
     you want.  Before you could only modify extension/color mappings for a
     fixed set of file types, but now you can add your own, or remove any you
     don't want.  This mapping is remembered between RText sessions.
   - Icons are now displayed alongside file names in the GUI.  These icons
     correspond to the files' types.
   - The default filter in the file dialog now displays all file types
     recognized and supported by RText.
   - Added a new icon group containg icons from Eclipse.  The icons in this
     group are under the Eclipse Public License.
   - Added a new icon group containing the BlueSphere icons
     (http://svgicons.sourceforge.net/).
   - A little GUI work on tables in the Options dialog.
   - Added Turkish translation (Burak).
   - Updated Dutch translation (Sebastiaan).
   - Updated Italian translation (stepagweb).
   - Updated to OfficeLnFs 1.1.0, which adds a new "Visual Studio 2005" Look
     and Feel.


0.9.2.0 (07/07/2005):
---------------------
   - The File System Tree now displays tooltips over filenames like Windows
     Explorer does.
   - Made the "Text Area" panel of the Options dialog a little nicer.
   - Code refactoring for the file chooser and file system tree.
   - Fixed a focus bug when drag-and-dropping tabs in the tabbed pane view.
   - Fixed a bug in the Background dialog.
   - A wait (hourglass) cursor is now displayed when the file chooser, options
     dialog, and help dialog are first created.  This gives a nice visual cue
     that the system is busy (and Java's just not hung) on slower systems.
   - Add country flags beside supported localizations in the Languages panel of
     the Options dialog.


0.9.1.6 (06/21/2005):
---------------------
   - Added a "File System Tree" plugin.  This plugin allows you to open
     files directly from a file tree in RText's UI, without having to open up
     the file chooser.
   - Added a "Search" menu, and moved all searching functionality out of
     the Edit menu.
   - Removed the "Format" menu, moving most functionality into the Options
     dialog.
   - Added "Go to Matching Bracket" menu item (Ctrl+[).
   - You can now delete multiple files simultaneously in the file chooser (you
     used to only be able to delete 1 at a time).
   - You can now use the Delete key to delete files in the file chooser (as
     opposed to the context menu).
   - Made the "Goto Line" dialog cancellable via the Escape key.
   - Decreased the creation time of the Options dialog.


0.9.1.3 (05/30/2005):
---------------------
   - Fixed a bug where using find/replace with regular expressions always did
     a case-insensitive search.
   - Fixed a bug that prevented the dialog stating the number of replacements
     done in a "replace all" from showing if the search string contained any
     regular expression characters.
   - The user can now get RText to use custom icon sets.  As an example, I will
     make an extra icon set available for download on RText's project site.
     There is also documentation of this in RText's online help.
   - The Source Browser is now an official "plugin," although it still comes
     standard with RText.  RText is now much closer to official plugin support.
   - Updated the Chinese translation.
   - Renaming of some internal stuff that should make things more clear when
     reading source code.


0.9.1.0 (04/22/2005):
---------------------
   - You can now drag-and-drop files into RText!  The encoding of the files
     will be automagically detected (files will be checked for Unicode; if they
     aren't a Unicode, the system default encoding is used) and syntax
     highlighting will be applied as necessary.
   - Add syntax highlighting for Java properties files.
   - Added syntax highlighting for Fortran.
   - Enhanced the Find in Files dialog:  When searching files with the dialog,
     Unicode files are now automatically recognized as such and searched
     correctly; before, they were (incorrectly) searched as the system's
     defualt encoding.  Also, if you are on Windows, filenames are now matched
     non-case-sensitively, as expected.
   - Added the ability to add file filters to the Open/Save dialog.  This is
     useful when you frequently use RText to modify files of a certain type
     that doesn't have its own filter by default.  (It's also a great feature
     to have when user-defined syntax highlighting becomes available, if it
     ever does...).  Anyway, the online help describes how to add file
     filters to the file chooser (it's just modifying an XML file).
   - Added French translation (thanks PivWan!).
   - Updated the Chinese translation (Ming).
   - The source browser now runs ctags in a separate thread.  There is no
     performance boost from this since the process is usually so short; rather,
     this was done so that we can kill the process if something goes wrong and
     it never returns (timeout is set at 10 seconds).
   - Updated the text area to correctly paint itself when it has borders.  The
     Look and Feels shipped with Java don't have borders around text areas, but
     JGoodies for example does.
   - Word-wrap mode is now much, much more effecient with documents containing
     very long lines.
   - If an Exception is caught and displayed in RText, it will now be syntax
     highlighted, just to make things a little more pretty.
   - Updated the text area's undo manager to be a little more efficient.
   - Updated SAS syntax highlighting; SAS allows strings to span multiple lines,
     but the old highlighter didn't paint this correctly; this is fixed.  Also,
     macro variables are now identified.
   - Made the Escape key hide the Options dialog and the About dialog.
   - Added a section on Java regular expressions to the online help's search
     section.
   - Upgraded to the Office Look and Feels to 1.0.5.
   - Changed the text component's document structure a little; should be
     (unnoticably) better performing now.
   - Refactored some of the syntax highlighting parsers.


0.9.0.8 (03/15/2005):
---------------------
   - Added menu items to increase or decrease the sizes of all fonts in the
     text areas simultaneously.  This is helpful because previously you would
     have had to go into the Options dialog and changed the size of each font
     individually.  These menu items are found in the View->Font Sizes menu.
   - Added support for 3rd party Look and Feels.  To use a 3rd party Look and
     Feel (such as the JGoodies looks), do the following:
        1. Place the Look and Feel's jar file in directory <RText-root>/lnfs.
        2. Open up the file <RText-root>/lnfs/lookandfeels.xml.  Add the XML
           necessary to have RText display your Look and Feel as an option
           (an example is in lookandfeels.xml).
        3. Restart RText.  In the Format->Look & Feel menu, you should now see
           the Look and Feel you added as an option!
     Your third party Look and Feel will be remembered and used on subsequent
     startups.  If the Jar file is moved, RText will default to the JRE's
     default look and feel.
   - Added Japanese translation (thanks tomoM!).
   - Updated Italian translation to have correct mnemonics.
   - The time/date stamp action (F5) now inserts a localized time/date stamp.
     Before it always used the format used by US Windows XP's Notepad.
   - Fixed a bug where a silent exception would be thrown if you tried to print
     when no print services were available.
   - Made changes to the internal workings of localization.
   - Upgraded to the new 1.0.2 Office Look and Feels jar.


0.9.0.6 (02/26/2005):
---------------------
   - RText can now load/save text files in any encoding supported by your JVM.
     Unicode files are still auto-detected (via checking for a BOM).  This is
     a wonderful improvement, as RText's old default encoding was US-ASCII,
     which wouldn't properly save characters needing more than 7 bits.  The new
     default encoding is OS dependant (Cp1252 for Windows, ISO-8859-1 for UNIX).
   - Gave the online Help a new title page, and improved the Help API a tad.
   - Added Italian translation (thanks stepagweb!).
   - Updated the Spanish translation (thanks daloporhecho!).


0.9.0.3 (02/22/2005):
---------------------
   - Added SQL syntax highlighting.
   - Added Indonesian translation (thanks Andi!), although you cannot
     actually use it as Sun's JRE doesn't support Indonesian.
   - Added the beginnings of the Simplified Chinese translation (thanks
     Ming!).
   - Added Dutch translation (thanks Martin!).
   - Made it easy to configure what languages are displayed as selectable in
     the "Language" panel of the Options dialog.  This is now done via an
     XML file.  This makes it easier for people translating RText into new
     languages to test their localizations before submitting them.
   - Isolated a bug in the Windows 1.4.2_06 JRE that made RText's custom
     file chooser not instantiate; this further caused the Options dialog to not
     be viewable.  This behavior was not seen in J2SE 1.5.0 Update 1.  In any
     case, a workaround is now in place.
   - Fixed bug: When the Java icon set was enabled, trying to bring up the
     Help dialog threw Exceptions that kept it from coming up.
   - Fixed bug: Opening a file when word wrap was enabled caused RText to
     hang!
   - Fixed a couple of bugs in the OfficeXP and Office2003 Look and Feels that
     didn't show themselves in RText, but may have in the future.
   - The Help dialog API now supports hyperlinks containing anchors.


0.9.0.0 (02/07/2005):
---------------------
   - RText is now translated into German!  You can change the language from the
     Options dialog.  Thanks to Pete Maier for maintaining this translation!
   - Made some changes to the source tree structure to allow for easier
     translation into other languages.  Note that many other languages are also
     now in the "Language" list in the Options dialog; these are works in
     progress, and will be functional in the next release.
   - Simplified some options parsing.  As a side effect of this, if you are
     upgrading from a previous verision of RText, the first time you start
     version 0.9.0.0, you'll likely receive a message about an Exception being
     thrown while loading options, and you may lose your preferences.  This will
     only happen the first time you start 0.9.0.0.
   - Cleaned up the Print Preview dialog's code.


0.8.9.9 (01/24/2005):
---------------------
   - Fixed Defect 872764 that was preventing background images from being
     usable on UNIX/Linux.
   - Updated the QuickSearch bar so that it's more user-friendly:  added
     icons to the "Find Next" and "Find Previous" buttons, made the search
     field select all of its text when it gains focus, and added a button
     directly on it to "hide" it.
   - Made XML syntax highlighting more efficient, and it also now recognizes
     CDATA sections and highlights them appropriately.
   - "virtual" wasn't being highlighted as a reserved word in C++ files.  This
     is fixed (bug 1108576).
   - Fixed a bug where, if a file was reloaded from disk because it was
     modified out from under your RText session, that file's encoding was set
     to a value RText couldn't understand, preventing you from being able to
     save the document unless you manually fixed the encoding in the
     "Document Properties" dialog (1108573).
   - Changed mouse-clicking behavior in the text area such that if you
     repeatedly click, every click after 3 alternates between selecting the
     current word and selecting the current line, to mimic Windows text
     components.
   - Made the OfficeXP Look and Feel a little more memory-efficient.


0.8.9.8 (01/17/2005):
---------------------
   - Added "code templates" (abbreviations).  This is a way to quickly
     insert text you frequently use while coding.  Whenever you type a
     space, if the previous token matches one of the template "abbreviations,"
     the value of the template is inserted into the document.  Common templates
     for C# and Java come standard; you can also add your own via the Options
     dialog.
   - Added a "QuickSearch toolbar" that can be toggle via the View menu.
     When visible, this toolbar is activated either by clicking in its search
     field or via Ctrl+F (or whatever shortcut you've defined for the "Find"
     action).  Simply type the text to search for; pressing Enter searches
     forward, Ctrl+Enter searches backward, and Escape places the caret back
     into the current text area.
   - C# syntax highlighting mistakenly highlighted "boolean" instead of "bool"
     as a data type; this is corrected.
   - Updated the Windows starter executable to add "-Dswing.aatext=true" to
     the command line; this should make the UI in general have better-looking
     fonts if you're using Sun's 5.0 JVM or greater.
   - Removed some unnecessary dependencies between various packages so
     more parts of RText can be used in other applications easily.
   - A tad more work on the plugin system.


0.8.9.7 (01/05/2005):
---------------------
   - The caret used by the text areas now no longer derives form DefaultCaret.
     It can now be configured to be a vertical line, an underline, a block or a
     rectangle for both insert and overwrite modes, and its blink rate can be
     configured, via the Text Area panel in the Options dialog.  Also, the new
     caret allowed us to fix the minor "bug" where switching between insert and
     overwrite modes while the caret was "blinked out" didn't make the caret
     immediately become visible, as it should.
   - A middle-mouse button click on Windows now performs a "paste."  UNIX
     variants and other systems that support a system selection still behave as
     they used to.
   - Redid the Online Help documentation.  It's now much more up-to-date,
     and the Help API has been made much simpler.  Help structure is no longer
     hard-coded into an application; rather, it is specified in an XML file.
   - Added the very beginning of a simple plugin system.  Note that "plugin"
     doesn't necessarily mean "anyone can extend RText;" rather, it means
     "it becomes easier for an RText developer to extend RText."  But, it's
     a start.
   - Various minor updates to the code.


0.8.9.6 (12/14/2004):
---------------------
   - Added x86 assembler syntax highlighting.
   - Added a new "Document Properties" option in the View menu.  This item
     brings up a dialog with summary statistics for the file (line and character
     count, file size, date modified, etc.).  From this dialog you can also
     change the file's encoding and line terminator (CR, LF, or CR/LF).  This
     feature can be handy, for example, when saving a file to a UNIX file system
     from a Windows terminal (you won't get all of those nasty ^M's  ;-)  ). 
   - Added a new shortcut:  Ctrl+J now joins the current line with the next one.
     This action is also found in the Edit menu.
   - Made the "current working directory" (i.e., the directory in which all
     "Untitled.txt" files are placed) configurable.  This option is found under
     a new Option dialog panel titled "General".  This property is remembered
     between RText sessions.
   - You can now toggle whether the file chooser's auto-complete list pops up
     while you are typing a filename into it.  You can toggle this property from
     the File Chooser option panel in the Options dialog.  This property was
     added because Java's file I/O operations tend to be slow over networks, and
     I didn't want this nice feature to be a bottleneck in those situations.
   - Decreased memory footprint by being a little bit smarter about what
     resource bundles I load when.
   - Fixed a bug in C, C++, Java, and C# syntax highlighting where strings with
     multiple escaped double-quote characters weren't colorized correctly.
   - Fixed a bug where opening a file from the File History in the File menu
     made the assumption that the file was ASCII.  RText now attempts to read
     a BOM at the beginning of a file before opening it this way; if one is
     found, it is opened as the proper Unicode encoding; otherwise, ASCII is
     used.
   - Fixed a bug that prevented shortcuts from being configurable in the Options
     dialog (pressing "Apply" simply didn't do anything because a
     NullPointerException was thrown).


0.8.9.5 (12/04/2004):
---------------------
   - You can now use different fonts for each individual token type!
     Although I find doing it distracting, others may like it.  As a side-
     effect, the "Font" menu item in the Format menu has been removed; the
     font used for plain text files is configurable in the Syntax Highlighting
     option panel under "Plain Text/Identifier".
   - Added the ability to make the edges of selections rounded.  This is
     configurable from the Options dialog.
   - A couple of minor fixes to some syntax highlighting lexers.
   - Fixed a bug where if you opened the same file twice (i.e., had
     "file.txt (1)" and "file.txt (2)"), and did a "Save As..." to save one of
     them with a new filename, the number for the other document(s) weren't
     changed/removed.
   - Fixed a bug in RTextArea's replaceRange() method that made certain text
     insertions require two undos to completely "undo."
   - Fixed a big bug that prevented the caret from being repositioned properly
     sometimes when word wrap was enabled.
   - Fixed a bug that made the combo boxes in the Find and Replace dialogs too
     wide if you entered a string into them longer than their preferred width.
   - You can now change the status bar's style in the Options dialog.  The
     current choices are "Windows 98-style" and "Windows XP-style."  This
     property is remembered between sessions.


0.8.9.4 (11/19/2004):
---------------------
   - Redid the syntax highlighting code for C, C++, Java, and C#.  These
     syntax styles are now over 33% faster, and are more intelligent.  Some
     changes in their behavior include:
        - Java:  Redone to completely follow the language specification in
          "The Java Language Reference" (O'Reilly, Mark Grand, 1997).
             - Identifiers can now have unicode escapes (e.g. "\u003D") in them
               and not be colored as errors.
             - All char literals are correctly identified as well-formed or
               errors (including valid escape sequences, octal chars ('\377'),
               and Unicode escapes ('\u54F7')).
             - String literals are now colored as invalid if they contain
               invalid escape sequences (such as "foo\899bar").
             - HTML tags in Javadoc comments are now recognized as such and
               highlighted.
        - C/C++:
             - Strings and char literals recognize trigraphs, simple escapes,
               octal escapes and hex escapes.  They will be painted as invalid
               tokens if an invalid escape is contained in them.
        - C#:  Redone to completely follow the language specification found at:
          http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=
                  /library/en-us/csspec/html/vclrfcsharpspec_C.asp
             - Strings and char literals recognize simple escapes, hexadecimal
               escapes and unicode escapes.  They will be painted as invalid
               tokens if an invalid escape is contained in them.
             - Verbatim strings are recognized and painted correctly.
             - Documentation comments "/// <...>" are identified and painted
               as such.  HTML tags inside of them (such as "<summary>") are
               highlighted as well.
     These enhancements were made possibly by JFlex (http://www.jflex.de).
     Thanks also go out to http://www.ostermiller.org/syntax for many ideas,
     inspiration, and test cases.
   - Made line numbering code more efficient.  There should be a slight
     performance boost because of this.
   - Added "Mark All" functionality to the find and replace dialogs.  The color
     used for "mark all" can be toggled in the Options dialog and is remembered
     between RText sessions.
   - Made find, replace, and replace all actions more memory efficient.
   - Fixed a bug where an NPE was thrown if you tried to bring up the file
     chooser, but its working directory was removed out from under it (1069094).
   - Fixed a bug where if you saved a read-only file with a new filename, the
     newly-created file was assumed to be read-only (even though it isn't)
     (1069102).
   - Fixed a bug where drag-and-drop FROM a text area in RText (not into) was
     accidentally disabled in 0.8.9.2.
   - Minor tweaks to the syntax highlighting code (made it more extendable,
     etc.).


0.8.9.3 (11/06/2004):
---------------------
   - RText now uses token styles (bold, italics) in word wrap mode!
   - Added JavaScript syntax highlighting, both for *.js files and inside
     "<script>"/"</script>" tag pairs when highlighting HTML.  This is
     configurable in the "File Filters" option panel.
   - Enhanced Java syntax highlighting as follows:
        - Javadoc metadata tags (@author, @version, etc.), are now highlighted.
        - Annotations are highlighted (JDK 5.0 addition)
        - Now colorizes Unicode char literals (e.g. '\u0003') as chars.  Before
          this release, such tokens were colored as errors.
   - Added the ability to toggle viewing whitespace. This is remembered
     between RText sessions.
   - Added menu items/actions to block-indent the current line/all selected
     lines (Alt+left arrow, Alt+right arrow).
   - Added menu items under the Edit menu to make the current selection upper-
     case, lower-case, or invert its case.  These actions will be remembered
     in macros.
   - Added a "Macro" option panel in the Options dialog.  From here you can
     delete old macros you don't want/need anymore.
   - Added a "File Chooser" option panel in the Options dialog.  From here you
     can fully configure the file chooser.
   - Added an option in the Options dialog to enable "smooth fonts" (i.e.,
     antialiasing).  This option is remembered between RText sessions.
   - Fixed a bug in macros where the actions cut, copy, paste, and delete
     wouldn't be recorded in a macro.
   - Modified the syntax-highlighting API to be more like that found in the
     javax.swing.text package.
   - Added a custom cursor for when macros are being recorded.
   - Enhanced the "file-system aware" text fields found in the file dialog and
     the find in files dialogs.  You can now actually scroll their popup menus
     via the mouse, and use page-up/down to scroll through them pages at a time.
   - Made the "Text Area" option panel into two separate panels, "Text Area"
     and "Syntax Highlighting".  Note that some of the options in the "Syntax
     Highlighting" panel may appear to belong in the "Text Area" one, but these
     options panels actually reflect options for RTextArea and RSyntaxTextArea
     respectively; thus, options for each text area are on their respective
     panels.  This unfortunately makes "Syntax Highlighting" an inaccurate
     option panel title.
   - Simplified the insert/overwrite caret code in RTextArea.
   - Made the Options dialog default to taking up much less screen real estate.
   - Fixed a bug where you could insert a time/datestamp or change some text's
     case via menu options when editing a read-only document.
   - Moved TimeDateAction from package org.fife.rtext to be a subclass in
     org.fife.ui.rtextarea.RTextAreaEditorKit.
   - Extended the default file associations to include *.pm files as Perl files
     and *.manifest files as XML (for C#).
   - Fixed up the Javadoc to build with no warnings.
   - A few other small bug fixes.


0.8.9.2 (09/29/2004):
---------------------
   - Added macro support.  Recording a temporary macro stores it in memory, and
     every time you execute a macro after that (Ctrl+Shift+M), the temporary
     macro will play.  If you record a non-temporary macro, you will be prompted
     for a name for it after you finish recording it.  It can then be accessed
     via the Macros menu.  Ctrl+Shift+M will always play back the last recorded/
     played macro, regardless of whether it was temporary or not.  The next
     release should see a "Macro Manager" panel in the Options dialog, where you
     will be able to remove/rename macros.  While recording a macro, the cursor
     currently changes to a crosshair cursor over text areas; a custom cursor
     will come with the next release.
   - Made the File chooser automatically detect the encoding of files.  Now,
     when you select a file, its encoding (one of ASCII, UTF-8, or one of the
     16-bit Unicodes) will be selected as well.
   - Added initial drag-and-drop support to the tabbed view.  You can now
     drag tabs across the tabbed pane to sort the documents opened in it.
   - Made the Options dialog resizable and spiced it up a tad.
   - Changed all "Color buttons" so they now present a popup menu when clicked
     instaed of a JColorChooser.  This popup has several common color "swatches"
     to choose from, as well as a menu item to bring up the color chooser.
     This feature should make it easier to change the various color properties
     in RText.
   - Made the status bar look Windows XP-ish, and made the Find in Files dialog
     use an "official" StatusBar instead of its own homebrew version.
   - Made the Help dialog into a JFrame so it can be minimized/put behind the
     main RText window, etc.
   - Improved undo/redo while in overwrite mode.
   - Fixed a benign NullPointerException from occuring when switching the view
     style from tabbed to any one of the others.
   - Fixed bug:  Case-insensitive languages such as HTML, Windows batch and SAS
     were being case-sensitive in their keyword identification.  This is fixed.


0.8.9.1 (09/07/2004):
---------------------
   - Enhanced the About dialog to contain some system information.
   - Made the Replace dialog's layout a little nicer.
   - Added mnemonics to Font dialog.
   - Made yet more preparations for macro support (still not there yet).
   - Enhanced auto-indent intelligence.
   - Made pressing the Home key first go to the first non-whitespace character
     on the current line, then to the first position in the line (used to be the
     other way around; this new behavior matches that of other programming
     editors).


0.8.9.0 (09/01/2004):
---------------------
   - Added "auto-indent" functionality to the text area.  It simply remembers
     the whitespace at the beginning of the previous line and applies it to the
     new line when you press Enter.  This is not yet configurable.
   - Added a "Shortcuts" section to the Options dialog where you can change the
     shortcuts (accelerators) associated with the various menu items.
   - Small optimizations to the syntax highlighting code.
   - Added the following key mappings:
      - Ctrl+Delete - Deletes the text from the caret position to the end of the
                      current line.
   - Made text area's input model more closely aligned with that of JTextArea.
   - Fixed a bug in the XML syntax highlighting with multiline tags.
   - Made the Print dialog contain the name of the file being printed as the
     "Job name."
   - Added more mnemonics here and there.
   - Began laying the foundation for macros.
   - Added "RText" 3D text to the About dialog and splash screen image.


0.8.8.9 (08/18/2004):
---------------------
   - Deleting from the longest line in no-line-wrap mode did not
	update the text area's horizontal scrollbar.  This was fixed.
   - Added XML syntax highlighting.
   - RText now handles long lines better (it's a little smarter about clipping
     when painting, and it shows up when scrolling a document with long lines).
   - Fixed a bug in the background rendering code when the background was set to
     an image that was introduced in 0.8.8.7.
   - HTML syntax highlighting sometimes broke down in 0.8.8.7 due to
     the expanded syntax highlighting styles; this should be fixed now.
   - Updated "Save a Copy as Web Page" to include the new syntax styles (bold,
     italic) in generated web pages.
   - Fixed a focus bug when using the tabbed pane view with a 1.5 JRE.
   - Made RTextAreas slightly more memory efficient.
   - The "Window" menu visible in MDI view wasn't properly updated
     when the user changed Look and Feels.  This was fixed.
   - Although it would never affect RText, a bug in the RTextArea API
     was fixed where if the user right-clicked to bring up the popup
     menu, but no icons had been assigned to the popup menu, an
     exception was thrown and the popup wasn't shown.  This was fixed,
     so now an RTextArea can show the popup menu with no icons.
   - FindInFilesDialog quietly threw an exception when the user double-
     clicked in the match list if it was empty.  Although it did no damage,
     it still got fixed.
   - Updated RTextFileChooser and FindInFilesDialog's constructors to
     use SpringLayout in a couple of places, simplifying their initialization.
   - Made the size grip friendlier toward *NIX systems that don't support
     java.awt.Robot.  You now don't get a dialog box with the "not supported"
     error every time you start up RText.


0.8.8.8 (08/11/2004):
---------------------
   - Changed all "file-system-aware" combo boxes into "file-system-aware"
     text fields.  These new components simplify the code a little, but more
     importantly, they're a little more flexible for the user (i.e., you can now
     select the only item in a one-item dropdown list).
   - Moved FindInFilesDialog into the more-apt org.fife.ui.search. Now any
     program can take advantage of the "find in files" features found in RText.
     You interact with it via a new FindInFilesListener interface.
   - Fixed a bug with file-system-aware combo boxes:  they didn't draw their
     borders in most Look-and-Feels.
   - Fixed a bug in line numbering code that sometimes kept the line numbers
     from being updated when the user inserted multiple lines.
   - Line numbering was very goobered when word wrap was enabled in the
     last release, thanks to my tweaking with the painting code.  This should
     be fixed now.
   - Internationalized the Find in Files dialog (translations for English and
     Spanish locales, just like the rest of RText).
   - Added mnemonics to the Find in Files dialog.


0.8.8.7 (08/07/2004):
---------------------
   - Added the ability to change the style of individual token types to
     include bold and italic.  This is a very nice feature that further extends
     the ability to customize the view and makes the code easier to grasp
     visually.  This is currently only available when word wrap is off; when
     word wrap is turned on, any individually-set token styles will be ignored.
   - Updated the line numbering code to be more efficient.
   - Added mnemonics to the various widgets on the Find and Replace dialogs.


0.8.8.6 (07/31/2004):
---------------------
   - Did some refactoring so more of RText's widgets and tools were usable by
     other applications.
   - You can now set the background color of tokens, as well as the text
     color.
   - Fixed an intermittent bug where the caret wouldn't properly change to
     reflect the text mode (insert vs. overwrite).


0.8.8.5 (07/19/2004):
---------------------
   - RText now uses its own custom file chooser for opening/saving files.
     I did this for several reasons, including:
        - The new file chooser is more flexible than the standard Java one.
          For all Look and Feels, it includes list, details, and icons views,
          as well as a right-click popup menu allowing you to rename files,
          delete files, create new directories, and more.
        - It knows what files are open, and displays open files with an
          underlined file name so you don't accidentally open the same file
          twice.
        - It recognizes file types RText can syntax-highlight, and color-
          codes them so you can easily pick them out.
        - I hate the Motif file chooser, and now I won't have to deal with
          it when I use RText on UNIX hosts.
     Soon there will be a panel in the Options dialog allowing you to
     configure the file chooser.
   - Added support for file encodings.  RText can now open files with ANSI,
     UTF-8, or Unicode encoding.  This is handled through the new file
     chooser.
   - The source browser can now be made floatable in its own window, as well
     as docked to one side of the main RText window.
   - Fixed a bug where the source browser didn't always destroy the spawned
     ctags process when an exception occured during its execution.


0.8.8.1 (06/22/2004):
---------------------
   - Made source browser refresh its contents when the current file
     is saved.
   - Made source browser tree's nodes expand/contract in response to
     single-clicks.


0.8.8.0 (06/19/2004):
---------------------
   - Added a Source Browser component.  This component requires you
     to have Exhuberant Ctags installed on your machine
     (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctags).  When the Source
     Browser is enabled, an extra panel is visible in RText listing
     all functions/variables, etc. found in the current document's
     code code; clicking on an item in this panel takes you directly
     to the item's definition.  This component is configurable via
     the Options dialog.
   - Added a right-margin line.  Useful for example if you want
     to keep your document's lines to 80 characters or less.  This
     is configurable from the "Text Area" panel on the Options
     dialog.
   - Coverted to use the Java Preferences API to remember your
     configuration between sessions.  This means that if you migrate
     from a previous version of RText to 0.8.7.1, the first time you
     start it back up, your options won't be remembered.  After that
     though, your options will be stored in the new location (OS-
     dependant), and everything will work as it did before.
   - Fixed a bug preventing a user from loading/saving files with
     names containing the '$' character.
   - Beefed up the Options dialog API.  You now cannot enter invalid
     file filters (you could trick it before), and on the whole, it
     checks for invalid input better.
   - Moved all "Tabs" options in Options dialog to the Text Area
     panel, as they made more sense there than as their own separate
     category.
   - Many smaller bux fixes.


0.8.7.0 (06/04/2004):
---------------------
   - Internationalized RText.  You can now choose between English
     and Spanish as the language used by the RText GUI.  Changes
     will not be made until RText is stopped and restarted.  New
     languages can easily be added in the future; if you are
     interested in translating RText to a new language, please
     contact me (see the bottom of this file).
   - Added bracket matching!  You can change the colors used
     to highlight matching brackets in the "Text Area" portion of
     the Options dialog.
   - Slightly optimized the Find algorithm when regular expressions
     aren't being used.
   - Optimized the Find in Files dialog.  Searches should now be
     much quicker (2-2.5x faster in most cases, from my tests).
   - Fixed bug:  Checking for file changes on disk would ask
     multiple times for the same file if more than one file was
     modified at the same time.
   - Added "file-system-aware" combo box as Find in Files
     dialog's "In Folder" combo.  It tries to be smart and gives
     you a list of all directories matching what you've typed
     thus far.
   - Added SAS syntax highlighting.  May not be 100% accurate, as I'm
     by no means a good SAS programmer.  It also isn't smart enough to
     recognize when tokens are in invalid locations (such as a proc name
     is in the middle of a data step), so it will always color tokens
     as it sees 'em.  Please let me know if you see a bug in this
     syntax highlighting scheme, and I'll be glad to fix it.
   - Added SAS file filters to open/save dialogs.


0.8.6.9 (05/15/2004):
---------------------
   - MANY updates to make RText run on Mac OS X.  Special thanks
     to Peter Wyss for making these changes and sharing his Mac
     expertise ;-)
   - Fixed bug:  Lack of "forward" and "backward" images for the
     Office2003 icon set made the Help dialog not show up when
     these icons were used.  This is now fixed.
   - Fixed bug:  When you switch to the MDI view from another
     view, there is no active window.
   - RText now checks for files being updated outside of the
     editor.  For example, if you have a file "foo.txt" open in
     RText, then open "foo.txt" in another editor and save it,
     RText will realize this and ask you whether or not you
     want to reload the file.
   - Fixed bug: The Read-only indicator was broken from when I
     added the ability to change your view style.  This is now
     fixed.
   - Changed recent file list in the File menu to be its own
     popup menu, allowing RText to remember many more files.
   - Made the "Recent Files" submenu keep track of the files in
     the order in which you opened them.
   - Fixed bug: The "current line highlighter" when word wrap was
     enabled was broken in 0.8.6.8.  I believe this is actually due
     to a bug in Sun's JRE.  Either way, it's fixed now.
   - You can now toggle word wrap and line numbers separately.  This
     means you can now have line numbers enabled while word wrap is on.
     This is due to a new line numbering class that enables more
     functionality and should be a little mor efficient.
   - Updated status bar indicators so that the line/column indicator
     should never truncate its text, even for very high line/column
     values.
   - Fixed bug: For Perl syntax highlighting, builtin "shell"
     variables (such as $@ and $!) messed up the rendering for the
     line they were on.  This is now fixed.
   - Fixed bug: When using the MDI view, the name of the currently
     active document in RText's title bar wasn't always properly
     updated.  This is now fixed.
   - Added an open document list to the Window menu, similar to that
     found in many MDI applications.  Clicking on one of the open
     document menu items makes that document the active one.


0.8.6.8 (04/29/2004):
---------------------
   - Added a third view style - an "MDI" view.  In this view,
     RText is basically a desktop pane with all open documents
     in floating internal frames.  When using this view style,
     a new Window menu is available (from the menu bar or by
     right-clicking on the desktop pane) that allows you to
     organize your desktop frames with the traditional
     "Tile Vertically," "Tile Horizontally," and "Cascade"
     options.  The MDI view style is useful when you want to
     modify two or more documents side-by-side, viewing both
     simultaneously.
   - Made the menu bar floatable.  It CANNOT be docked on the
     left- or right- hand side of RText; it can only be docked
     on the top or bottom, or made floatable.  Although this
     isn't necessarily a useful feature, it is functionality
     found in more recent Microsoft products, and so I
     decided to see whether or not I could mimic it.
   - Look and Feels:
        - Added a new Look and Feel - "Office 2003".  This
          Look and Feel just mimics the blue toolbar and
          menubar found in Office 2003 applications.
        - Updated the Office XP Look and Feel.  Hopefully all
          colors used are now 100% accurate.  Made the menu
          bar item correctly "connect" to the popup menu when
          the popup menu appears above the menu bar.  Made
          toolbar grips look like Office XP toolbar grips.
          Made grip disappear when the toolbar is made
          floatable.
   - Right-clicking the toolbar now allows you to add or remove
     buttons from it.  Also included is a "Reset the toolbar"
     choice which replaces all buttons.
   - Fixed a bug that made insert/overwrite not work sometimes
     when the Look and Feel was changed.
   - Added new icon set:  Office XP icons.
   - Fixed bug:  In the options dialog, if you chose Split Pane
     view with the document selection being somewhere other than
     "left," and clicked the Apply button, the document selection
     was still placed on the left.  Clicking "Okay" placed the
     document selection pane correctly.  This is now fixed.


0.8.6.7 (04/16/2004):
---------------------
   - Made Undo/Redo much more intelligent; it now behaves much
     like undo functionality in Microsoft Word or other
     commercial applications:
        - Groups of characters typed together are remembered as
          a single edit, and so undo no longer removes text one
          character at a time.
        - A "replace" action is remembered as a single edit
          instead of two (a remove, then a replace).
   - Syntax highlighting:
        - HTML:  Made tags able to be multiline.  In the last
          release, only comment tags could be multiline, but
          now any kind of open tag can span multiple lines.
   - Added right-click popup options menu to the toolbar.
     Currently the only thing you can do from this menu is
     "lock" the toolbar (toggle whether or not it is floatable).
   - Improved the OfficeXP Look and Feel:
        - Combo boxes now look like the newer Windows "flat
          style" combo boxes found, for example, in the toolbar
          of Outlook XP.
        - Made the colors used for menu item selection more
          accurate.
   - Made Find/Replace dialogs go away on escape keypress (this
     mostly worked in past versions, but was a little dodgy).
   - Factored find/replace dialogs out of rtext package into
     their own generic package.  This makes for better logical
     segregation of code, as well as makes the search dialogs
     available to different Java projects.
   - Factored other pieces of code out of project-specific rtext
     package into more general packages, so they can be used by
     other projects.
   - Cleaned up a few of the icons again.


0.8.6.6 (04/07/2004):
---------------------
   - Syntax highlighting:
        - Added HTML syntax highlighting.
   - Fixed bug - Line/column indicator stopped working on the
     currently active document when you switch from split-pane
     view to tabbed pane view (and not vice-versa).  You would
     have to switch active documents, then switch back to get
     the line/column indicator to work on the originally active
     document.  This is now fixed.
   - Took out some debug code that wrote to stderr, which probably
     slowed some stuff down a tad in 0.8.6.5.


0.8.6.5 (04/02/2004):
---------------------
   - Syntax highlighting:
        - Added Perl syntax highlighting.  Note that this currently
          does NOT currently handle patterns (/foo/, s/foo/bar/, etc.),
          as I didn't have the time to add them.
        - All: Increased efficiency during insert/delete text.
        - C, C++, C#, Java: Removed a little unnecessary code in
          parser.
        - Fixed a bug in the C++ highlighting code that prevented
          the '~' character from being interpreted as the beginning
          of a destructor method.
   - Added "Save a Copy as Web Page..." option in File menu.  Now
     you can export your syntax highlighted souce code into an HTML
     file for display on the web.
   - The toolbar is now dockable.  Until now it's not been dockable,
     as I didn't know how to keep the status bar from interfering with
     the toolbar when it was docked at the bottom.  After some clever
     work with nested JPanels, it's now working ;-)
   - Added an option to highlight the display names of modified
     documents with a different color.  For example, if you have
     opened and modified a document "foo.txt", then the "foo.txt*"
     found on that document's tab or in the document list split pane
     can be highlighted red (or any other color) as a visual cue of
     unsaved modifications.  This preference is saved between RText
     sessions.
   - Enhanced line numbers; the highlight of the current line's line
     number is now toggled with the current line highlight option,
     and the color with which the current line number is highlighted
     now matches the current line's highlight color.  This makes
     things look a little nicer.
   - Fixed a bug that made all search options ("Match Case", etc.)
     not modifiable if you changed the view style.
   - Fixed a bug where the line/column indicator was always enabled
     on startup, even if word wrap was enabled.
   - Improved handling of Home/Insert keypresses and actions.


0.8.6.4 (03/25/2004):
---------------------
   - Syntax highlighting:
        - UNIX shell: Fixed bug in quoted string termination.
        - Added C# syntax highlighting.
   - Fixed a bug in undo/redo.
   - Added new "view" - a split pane view.  I find this to be a
     much cleaner view than the tabbed pane, but the choice is yours;
     you can toggle between the two views.  Your choice is remembered
     between RText sessions.
   - Fixed bug - Find in Files dialog went into a loop when you
     tried to do a find with an invalid regular expression.
   - Made syntax filters case-insensitive.  This way, AUTOEXEC.BAT
     will be syntax highlighted if the Windows batch file filter
     contains "*.bat".


0.8.6.3 (03/19/2004):
---------------------
   - Syntax Highlighting:
        - Added Windows batch file syntax.
        - Added UNIX shell syntax.
   - Added the ability to have the text editor highlight the current
     line.  This feature can be toggled and the highlighting color
     can be changed via the options dialog.  This property is also
     remembered between RText sessions.
   - Added file filters to the Open/Save dialog corresponding to the
     file types now recognized for syntax highlighting.
   - Factored out logic code from display code in the class that
     was in charge of displaying the tabbed pane of text areas.  This
     allows for the possibility of alternate views (besides just being
     better programming).
   - Fixed bug - If you closed a document in a "middle tab" (i.e.,
     not the first or last tab when three or more files are open), the
     file name displayed in the title bar wouldn't update.
   - Fixed bug - File history was remembered in reverse order.  Thus,
     if your file history contained files a.txt, b.txt, and c.txt, in
     that order, and you closed and reopened RText 0.8.6.2, your file
     history would contain the files in the order c.txt, b.txt, a.txt.
   - Now better at catching errors in rtext.properties file; if the
     properties file is invaild in any way, RText will give you a
     dialog box at startup telling you as much, and use the defaults.
   - Touched up a few of the 16x16 WinXP/Win98 icons.


0.8.6.2 (03/06/2004):
---------------------
   - Touchups to syntax highlighting:
        - C, C++, Java: Fixed a bug that caused exceptions to be thrown
                        sometimes if a multiline comment's end token was
                        modified.
        - Java: Made all java.lang.* classes, interfaces, exceptions and
                errors into syntax highlighted tokens.  I classified them
                as "functions" even though they aren't functions, but
                I didn't have a token type descriptive enough for them.
   - Updated Options Dialog:
        - You can now decide what file extensions get associated with
          what file types, and thus control what files get syntax
          highlighted.
        - Fixed 'Text Area' panel so that clicking the 'Restore Defaults'
          button only enables the Apply button when it changes something.
   - RText once again remembers more between sessions:
        - Whether or not the window was maximized.
        - File filters
        - File history
   - Fixed bug: Background as image stopped working on Windows with the
     introduction of syntax highlighting.


0.8.6.1 (02/27/2004):
---------------------
   - Touchups to syntax highlighting:
        - All:     Word wrap now works with syntax highlighting.
        - C, C++:  Made characters '?' and ':' highlighted as operators.
                   Preprocessor directives now colored.
        - Java:    Made characters '?' and ':' highlighted as operators.
                   Documentation comments distinguished from
                   multiline comments.
   - Overhaul of Options dialog; designed to reflect more modern
     Options dialog style found in many Windows applications.  Also
     added support for customizing syntax highlighting and other text
     area options.
   - RText now remembers more of your preferences between sessions:
     whether or not word wrap was on, caret color, selection color, and
     syntax highlighting colors.
   - Fixed small bug involving changing carets and selections:  if you
     had a selection then switched from insert to overwrite mode or
     vice versa and moved the caret, it appeared that the old selection
     stayed (even though it really didn't).  This is now fixed.
   - Block caret used in overwrite mode now sizes itself to the character
     it's over; this makes it look a little nicer when using a
     proportional font.
   - Fixed up inline comments; Javadoc now generates with no errors
     or warnings.
   - Fixed bug: Bad regular expressions in find/replace operations threw
     unreported exceptions and appeard to not do anything; you now get a
     dialog box telling you to check your regular expression.


0.8.6.0 (02/24/2004):
---------------------
   - VERY PRELIMINARY support for syntax highlighting.  Currently
     supported languages are:
            1. Java
            2. C
            3. C++
     You currently have no control over the syntax highlighting.  When
     you open a file with an appropriate file extension (.java, .c, etc.),
     syntax highlighting will be used appropriately for that file.  You
     cannot currently change the color scheme used for syntax highlighting.
     Word wrap is not yet supported when syntax highlighting; if you
     turn on word wrap while editing a *.java/*.c/*.cpp/*.h file, you
     will not be able to scroll horizontally in the file.  All of these
     issues will be fixed in the next couple of releases, after I ensure
     that the syntax highlighting is working correctly.
   - Fixed nasty bug where cut, copy and delete actions alternated
     between active/inactive when the selection size grew/shrank.
   - Fixed very malicious bug that slowed RText down when dealing with
     files much larger than 500 kb... It has since been tested on a
     2.12 MB file (representing over 60,000 lines of Java source code)
     and it ran fine.  Further scalability testing may come later.
     

0.8.5.0 (01/23/2004):
---------------------
   - RText now remembers some of your editing preferences between
     sessions, such as look and feel, icon set, font, background,
     window size, etc.  The next release should remember much more.
   - Worked around a Java "bug" where the default backspace action is
     triggered by the same event as Ctrl+H, thus whenever you used that
     shortcut to bring up the Replace dialog, the character previous to
     the cursor position was deleted.
   - Made text fields on Replace dialog and Find in Files dialog
     into "smart" combo boxes that remember your last searches.
   - Changed default button on Replace dialog from "Replace Next" to
     "Find Next" for safety reasons.
   - Fixed a bug where if you opened the Find or Replace dialog, then
     closed all open documents, you could still perform the search
     and get some Java exception.  You now get a message box telling
     you there's no text to search.
   - Fixed a bug in the Find dialog's combo box where you would have
     to press enter twice to do a search whenever you changed the
     search string (damn Java JComboBoxes...).
   - The File History in the File menu now intelligently abbreviates
     file paths, instead of just sticking an elipsis wherever it
     feels like it.
   - When you do a "Replace All", RText now tells you how many times
     it did the replacement.
   - Find in Files dialog now clearly identifies multi-line regular
     expression matches as such, to help prevent some confusion.
   - Fixed a bug where if you double-clicked on a "<Verbose>" line
     in the Find in Files dialog that described a directory, RText
     would try to open the directory as if it were a file, and give
     you an error indicating it couldn't do so.  Now it tells you
     that the line describes a directory.
   - Fixed a bug where opening a document from the Find in Files
     dialog didn't add the document to the File menu's "File
     History."
   - Find in Files dialog now updates it's "status bar" when you
     double-click on an search result to open the file, telling you
     what file it opened.
   - RText's status bar now has more to say; it changes its message
     when you open a file, close a file, and more.
   - Enhanced the "File History" in the File menu so that, if there
     are no recently opened files, it shows just 1 separator, not 2
     (very minor change, I know; but it was bugging me).


0.8.4.0 (01/15/2004):
---------------------
   - Find in Files dialog now fully operational (added Regular Expression
     searching, searching subdirectories, and some UI "prettiness"
     enhancements).
   - Fixed JRE 1.4 bug cauing popup menus to disappear when a modal dialog
     is displayed (See
	http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4911422.html
     for more details).  Hopefully this won't break anything else...
     Also note that I didn't fix this for the Mac Look and Feel, so it
     will still have this bug.  All other LnF's should be okay.
   - Added "Printing" tab to Options dialog, allowing you to configure some
     printing options.  From here, you can specify whether you want to always
     print using RText's current font, or always print with some other font
     (for example, you may edit with a larger font, but print with a smaller-
     point font to save paper).
   - Made the edit field on the Find dialog into a combo box that remembers
     your last few searches.  Eventually, I will do the same thing for
     the text fields in the Replace and Find in Files dialogs.
   - Fixed bug where printing cut off first line of every page (see
     Request ID #859349).
   - Updated text editor so that repeatedly pressing the "Home" key moves
     the cursor between the start of the current line and the first non-tab,
     non-space character on the current line.  This is sort of a programmer's
     editor thing I think, but I like it.
   - Updated Find dialog so that the edit box isn't extra tall when using
     the Motif Look and Feel.
   - Changed the startup code to give more information when RText is
     initializing, in the hopes of finding out why it hangs when starting
     on MacOS X 10.2.x - Perhaps it has to do with Robot...

0.8.3.5 (01/07/2004):
---------------------
   - Huge overhaul of printing.  Before, whenever you printed, it always came
     out in a monospaced font.  Now, RText prints in whatever font and size
     you're currently editing with.  This is a big change!
   - Overhaul of the Print Preview dialog.  Added zoom in/zoom out
     functionality, and tried to speed up performance a bit when flipping
     through pages.

0.8.3  (12/23/2003):
--------------------
   - Redid the "Find in Files" dialog's UI, and added some functionality.  You
     can now search for files (as long as you don't use the Regular Expression
     option, it's still broken), and open files from this dialog by double-
     clicking on them.  Note that this is STILL an unfinished part of RText
     and may not work properly; however, if you find it not working as you'd
     expect, please post a bug report and let me know!
   - Fixed "Linux - BG Dialog doesn't position preview image correctly" bug
     (see Request ID 863395).
   - Fixed "Linux - UI allows you to choose Windows & XP LnF" bug (see
     Request ID 863684).
   - Fixed "Opening second document makes some Java/WinXP menu icons big" bug
     (See Request ID 864448).
   - Fixed "Background dialog allows you to select 'No Image' as BG (see Request
     ID 863682).
   - I also finally got a Linux box (running RedHat Linux 9) available for
     testing!  So now, all versions will be tested on Win98, WinXP and Linux.

0.8.2:
------
   I didn't keep a change log before 0.8.3.  Sorry!
