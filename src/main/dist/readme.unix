Instructions:

Simply place this rtext/ directory wherever you want and add it to your PATH.
You can then either run the jar directly like so:

$ <java-path>/java -jar <rtext-path>/rtext/rtext.jar

or, you can make the above a one-liner shell script in your ~/bin directory.
It's your choice.
