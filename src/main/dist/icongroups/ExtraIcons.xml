     This file defines all icon groups available to RText.

     Additional icon groups can be downloaded from
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtext.  These icon groups will be in
     Jar files that should be placed in the directory
     <RText-root>/icongroups, where <RText-root> is the directory in which
     you installed RText.  The new icon group(s) will then be available via
     the Options dialog.

     To add a custom icon group, add all icons to a jar file, say
     "MyIcons.jar".  Place MyIcons.jar in <RText-root>/icongroups.  Then,
     add some XML to this file in the following format:
        <group name="<group-name>"
              path="<icon-path>"
              extension="<extension>"
              jar="<jar>"/>
     where:
       <name>      is the "name" of the icon group as it will appear in
                   RText's options dialog.  You could specify, for example,
                   "My Icon Group".
       <icon-path> is the path in the Jar file of the icons.  For example,
                   if the Jar contained icons under org/fife/rtext/icons,
                   this value would be "org/fife/rtext/icons/".
                   If the icons are in the "root directory" of the Jar,
                   this parameter can be omitted.
       <extension> is the extension of the image files.  This value must be
                   one of "gif", "jpg", or "png", as Swing understands
                   those image types.  If you leave this value off, RText
                   defaults to "gif".
       <jar>       is the RELATIVE PATH from the RText install to the Jar
                   file.  In this example, this value would be:
                   icongroups/MyIcons.jar.

     Note that you can also simply have the icons in a directory instead of
     in a Jar file.  In this case, <icon-path> should be the FULL PATH of
     the directory containing the icons, and the <jar> parameter should not
     be specified at all.

     NOTE: Do NOT remove the "Eclipse Icons" entry - this is the default icon
           group used by RText.  If you remove this entry, RText may not start!

     Please see RText's Help for more information.
