    This file contains all 3rd party Swing Look and Feels that will appear
    in RText's Look and Feel menu.

    *** MODIFY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  Incorrectly specifying a LookAndFeel can
    cause RText to hang on startup!  Some LookAndFeels are very picky about
    how they are loaded/configured, and others are poorly designed; RText
    cannot anticipate all possibilities.  If you add a LookAndFeel to this file,
    try to use it, and RText freezes or no longer starts, you can remedy this
    situation by simply removing the entry for the rogue LookAndFeel from this
    XML file and restarting RText.  It will fall back to a standard LookAndFeel.

    If you want a 3rd party Look and Feel (such as the JGoodies looks or
    Kunststoff), you must add it here.  The format is as follows:

       <LookAndFeel name="<name>" class="<class>" jars="<jar>"/>
    
    or:
    
       <LookAndFeel name="<name>" class="<class>" dir="<dir>"/>

    where:

       <name>  is the Look and Feel's name (preferably from lnf.getName()).
               This will be displayed in a list of choices in the Options
               dialog.
       <class> is the Look and Feel's main class.
       <jars>  is the jar file containing the Look and Feel.  This path
               should be relative to the RText installation directory.  If a
               Look and Feel requires more than one jar, they should be
               separated by commas.
       <dir>   An alternative to the <jars> attribute.  If you have a LaF with
               lots of jars (e.g. Substance), you can point to a root directory
               containing them all.  This directory should be relative to the
               RText installation directory.

    An example:  For the JGoodies Plastic look and feel, place the Look's
    jar file (e.g. looks-1.3.jar) under RText's "lnfs" directory and add
    the following line below:
 
        <LookAndFeel name="JGoodies Plastic"
           class="com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticLookAndFeel"
           jars="lnfs/looks-1.3.jar"/>

    Note that RText works with Java 17+.  If you define a LookAndFeel here that
    only works with, say, Java 18+, you should specify this by adding a
    "minJavaVersion" parameter in the form:
    
       minJavaVersion="18"
       minJavaVersion="18"
       etc.

    Doing so will cause RText to not even suggest that LookAndFeel if the
    current Java Runtime isn't new enough for it.
